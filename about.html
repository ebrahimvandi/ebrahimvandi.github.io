            <!-- Add your professional headshot here if desired: <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Alireza Ebrahimvandi"> -->
            <p>Hello! I'm Dr. Alireza Ebrahimvandi, a Data Scientist with a deep-rooted passion for applying quantitative methods to solve critical challenges, particularly within the healthcare domain. My academic journey culminated in a Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech, where I also earned my M.Sc. in Operations Research, both with a perfect GPA.</p>
            <p>My research and professional experience have centered on the development and implementation of innovative solutions using machine learning, artificial intelligence, simulation, and operations research. I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions and tangible improvements.</p>
            <p>At the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Medical System, I am currently developing and deploying AI-powered tools, including large language models for cancer trial matching and predictive models for bed availability. Prior to UCSF, I served as a Healthcare Data Scientist at the University of Maryland Medical System, where I focused on improving patient satisfaction, reducing ED wait times through simulation, and developing influential COVID-19 predictive models that outperformed established benchmarks.</p>
            <p>My doctoral research at Virginia Tech, funded by the Ohio Department of Medicaid, involved creating predictive and system dynamics models to address infant mortality and preterm birth, aiming to inform policies for high-risk populations.</p>
            <p>I am driven by the potential of data to revolutionize healthcare, making it more efficient, equitable, and patient-centered. I am always eager to connect with fellow professionals and explore new opportunities to make a meaningful impact.</p>
