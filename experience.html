        <article class="job">
            <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
            <p><strong>University of California San Francisco Medical System</strong> | San Francisco, California</p>
            <p><em>April 2022 - Present</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed and tested AI-powered tools leveraging large language models to automate the process of matching patients to suitable cancer trials.</li>
                <li>Designed and deployed predictive models for bed availability across diverse unit types, enhancing real-time decision-making for the Patient Capacity Management Center.</li>
                <li>Built and validated simulation models to optimize patient flow, directly engaging with medical leadership to support strategic planning such as adding new MRI machines, and scenario analyses.</li>
                <li>Led validation and evaluation of multiple machine learning models, including Epic's 30-day Readmission Risk and Hospital-Acquired Sepsis Risk models, ensuring accuracy and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="job">
            <h3>Healthcare Data Scientist</h3>
            <p><strong>University of Maryland Medical System</strong> | Linthicum Height, Maryland</p>
            <p><em>December 2019 - April 2022</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved patient satisfaction by designing quasi-experiments, finding matched cohorts, analyzing survey responses, and providing insights and recommendations to the Medical System CEO.</li>
                <li>Reduced ED wait times by two to four hours after simulating the process and providing optimized discharge times.</li>
                <li>Developed predictive models for the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU beds, and required testing capacity. The model outperformed reputable models such as Johns Hopkins COVID-19 model for Maryland by leveraging behavioral feedback loops.</li>
            </ul>

        <article class="job">
            <h3>Graduate Research Assistant</h3>
            <p><strong>Virginia Tech</strong> | Blacksburg, Virginia</p>
            <p><em>August 2016 - December 2019</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed predictive and system dynamics model of infant mortality/preterm birth in the state of Ohio. Funded by the Ohio Department of Medicaid, this project aimed to evaluate policies that would mitigate high rates of infant mortality and preterm birth for high-risk individuals.</li>
